# SQL-injection on metasploitable 3
__Sources:__ http://terokarvinen.com/2018/install-metasploitable-3-vulnerable-target-computer
In this exercise, I attempt SQL-injection on a specially made, vulnerably virtual machine. As I already have the required programs(virtualbox and vagrant) installed on my home computer, starting the exercise is simple: I just create the required Vagrantfile in a new folder
```## Vagrantfile
## http://terokarvinen.com/2018/install-metasploitable-3-vulnerable-target-computer
 Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
   config.vm.box = "rapid7/metasploitable3-ub1404"
   config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
end
```
and start Vagrant with `vagrant up`. After navigating to 127.0.0.1:8080, I'm presented with the following screens:\ https://www.dropbox.com/s/kby66f7clyyybly/Screenshot1.png?dl=0 \

This seems promising. I don't know any usernames or passwords, though. Let's try `user` and `1' OR '1=1` and see what happens.\

Looks like it worked!
